Introduction
============

A practical library for validating and normalizing data structures against a given schema with a smart, easy-to-understand API.

Documentation can be found on the [website](https://doc.nette.org/schema).

Installation:

```shell
composer require nette/schema
```

It requires PHP version 8.1 and supports PHP up to 8.5.

Thank you!


Basic Usage
-----------

In the variable `$schema`, we have a validation schema (we'll explain what this means and how to create one in a moment), and in the variable `$data`, we have the data structure we want to validate and normalize. This could be, for example, data submitted by a user via an API, a configuration file, etc.

The task is handled by the [Nette\Schema\Processor](https://api.nette.org/schema/master/Nette/Schema/Processor.html) class, which processes the input and either returns normalized data or throws a [Nette\Schema\ValidationException](https://api.nette.org/schema/master/Nette/Schema/ValidationException.html) exception if an error occurs.

```php
$processor = new Nette\Schema\Processor;

try {
	$normalized = $processor->process($schema, $data);
} catch (Nette\Schema\ValidationException $e) {
	echo 'Data is invalid: ' . $e->getMessage();
}
```

The method `$e->getMessages()` returns an array of all messages as strings, and `$e->getMessageObjects()` returns all messages as [Nette\Schema\Message](https://api.nette.org/schema/master/Nette/Schema/Message.html) objects.


Defining the Schema
-------------------

And now let's create the schema. The class [Nette\Schema\Expect](https://api.nette.org/schema/master/Nette/Schema/Expect.html) is used to define it; we essentially define expectations for what the data should look like. Let's say the input data must be a structure (e.g., an array) containing elements `processRefund` of type bool and `refundAmount` of type int.

```php
use Nette\Schema\Expect;

$schema = Expect::structure([
	'processRefund' => Expect::bool(),
	'refundAmount' => Expect::int(),
]);
```

We believe the schema definition looks understandable, even if you're seeing it for the first time.

Let's send the following data for validation:

```php
$data = [
	'processRefund' => true,
	'refundAmount' => 17,
];

$normalized = $processor->process($schema, $data); // OK, passes validation
```

The output, i.e., the value `$normalized`, is a `stdClass` object. If we wanted the output to be an array, we would add casting `->castTo('array')` to the schema.

All elements of the structure are optional and have a default value of `null`. Example:

```php
$data = [
	'refundAmount' => 17,
];

$normalized = $processor->process($schema, $data); // OK, passes validation
// $normalized = {'processRefund' => null, 'refundAmount' => 17}
```

The fact that the default value is `null` does not mean it would accept `'processRefund' => null` in the input data. No, the input must be a boolean, i.e. `true` or `false` only. We would have to explicitly allow `null` using `Expect::bool()->nullable()`.

An item can be made mandatory using `Expect::bool()->required()`. We can change the default value, for example, to `false` using `Expect::bool()->default(false)` or shorthand `Expect::bool(false)`.

And what if we wanted to accept `1` and `0` in addition to booleans? Then we list the values that we also want to normalize to boolean:

```php
$schema = Expect::structure([
	'processRefund' => Expect::anyOf(true, false, 1, 0)->castTo('bool'),
	'refundAmount' => Expect::int(),
]);

$normalized = $processor->process($schema, $data);
is_bool($normalized->processRefund); // true
```

Now you know the basics of defining a schema and how the structure items behave. We will now show what other elements you can use when defining a schema.


Data Types: type()
------------------

All standard PHP data types can be specified in the schema:

```php
Expect::string($default = null)
Expect::int($default = null)
Expect::float($default = null)
Expect::bool($default = null)
Expect::null()
Expect::array($default = [])
Expect::list($default = [])
```

And also all types [supported by the Validators class](https://doc.nette.org/validators#toc-expected-types), for example `Expect::type('scalar')` or shorthand `Expect::scalar()`. Also class or interface names, e.g., `Expect::type('AddressEntity')`.

Union syntax can also be used:

```php
Expect::type('bool|string|array')
```

The default value is always `null` with the exception of `array` and `list`, where it is an empty array. (A list is an array indexed by a sequence of numeric keys starting from zero, i.e. a non-associative array).


Array of Values: arrayOf() listOf()
-----------------------------------

An array represents too general a structure; it's more useful to specify precisely which elements it may contain. For example, an array whose elements can only be strings:

```php
$schema = Expect::arrayOf('string');

$processor->process($schema, ['hello', 'world']); // OK
$processor->process($schema, ['a' => 'hello', 'b' => 'world']); // OK
$processor->process($schema, ['key' => 123]); // ERROR: 123 is not a string
```

The second parameter can specify keys (since version 1.2):

```php
$schema = Expect::arrayOf('string', 'int');

$processor->process($schema, ['hello', 'world']); // OK
$processor->process($schema, ['a' => 'hello']); // ERROR: 'a' is not an int
```

A list is an indexed array:

```php
$schema = Expect::listOf('string');

$processor->process($schema, ['a', 'b']); // OK
$processor->process($schema, ['a', 123]); // ERROR: 123 is not a string
$processor->process($schema, ['key' => 'a']); // ERROR: not a list
$processor->process($schema, [1 => 'a', 0 => 'b']); // ERROR: also not a list
```

With the `wrap` parameter, a single value is also accepted and wrapped into a one-item list (since version 1.4):

```php
$schema = Expect::listOf('string', wrap: true);

$processor->process($schema, 'hello'); // OK, gives ['hello']
$processor->process($schema, ['a', 'b']); // OK
```

The parameter can also be a schema, so we can write:

```php
Expect::arrayOf(Expect::bool())
```

The default value is an empty array. If you specify a default value, it will be merged with the passed data. This can be disabled using `mergeDefaults(false)` (since version 1.1).


Enumeration: anyOf()
--------------------

`anyOf()` represents a set of values or schemas that a value can take. Here's how to write an array of elements that can be either `'a'`, `true`, or `null`:

```php
$schema = Expect::listOf(
	Expect::anyOf('a', true, null),
);

$processor->process($schema, ['a', true, null, 'a']); // OK
$processor->process($schema, ['a', false]); // ERROR: false does not belong there
```

The elements of the enumeration can also be schemas:

```php
$schema = Expect::listOf(
	Expect::anyOf(Expect::string(), true, null),
);

$processor->process($schema, ['foo', true, null, 'bar']); // OK
$processor->process($schema, [123]); // ERROR
```

The `anyOf()` method accepts variants as separate parameters, not as an array. To pass it an array of values, use the unpack operator `anyOf(...$variants)`.

Variants are tried in the order they are written and the first matching one wins. The single exception is `null`: when it belongs to the accepted values, a `null` input always gives `null`, even though a structure or an array variant would otherwise read it as an empty value of its own.

The default value is `null`. Use the `firstIsDefault()` method to make the first item the default:

```php
// default is 'hello'
Expect::anyOf(Expect::string('hello'), true, null)->firstIsDefault();
```


Enums: enum()
-------------

A configuration file can only carry a plain string like `'hearts'`, but in your code you would much rather work with an enum. That is the gap `enum()` closes (since version 1.4): give it an enum with a backing value (`enum Suit: string`) and it accepts either the backing value or the case itself, always handing you back the case:

```php
enum Suit: string
{
	case Hearts = 'hearts';
	case Spades = 'spades';
}

$schema = Expect::enum(Suit::class);

$processor->process($schema, 'hearts');     // OK, returns Suit::Hearts
$processor->process($schema, Suit::Spades); // OK, returns Suit::Spades
$processor->process($schema, 'clubs');      // ERROR: expects to be Suit
```

Enums backed by integers work exactly the same, and so does everything you know from the other elements, such as `Expect::enum(Suit::class)->required()` or `->default(Suit::Hearts)`.

You often do not have to reach for `enum()` explicitly. An enum class name is recognized in a type expression and when [generating a schema from a class](#mapping-to-objects-from), so `Expect::type(Suit::class)` and a `public Suit $suit` property give you the very same element.


Structures
----------

Structures are objects with defined keys. Each key-value pair is referred to as a "property".

Structures accept arrays and objects and return `stdClass` objects.

By default, all properties are optional and have a default value of `null`. You can define mandatory properties using `required()`:

```php
$schema = Expect::structure([
	'required' => Expect::string()->required(),
	'optional' => Expect::string(), // default value is null
]);

$processor->process($schema, ['optional' => '']);
// ERROR: option 'required' is missing

$processor->process($schema, ['required' => 'foo']);
// OK, returns {'required' => 'foo', 'optional' => null}
```

A structure itself is mandatory. Therefore, if it is nested inside another structure and the input does not contain it, it is created anyway - and it reports an error when it contains a required property. Use `required(false)` to make the entire nested structure optional. If it is missing in the input, `null` appears in the output, but if it is present, its required properties are enforced:

```php
$schema = Expect::structure([
	'db' => Expect::structure([
		'dsn' => Expect::string()->required(),
	])->required(false),
]);

$processor->process($schema, []);
// OK, returns {'db' => null}

$processor->process($schema, ['db' => []]);
// ERROR: 'db › dsn' is missing
```

If you do not want properties with default values in the output, use `skipDefaults()`:

```php
$schema = Expect::structure([
	'required' => Expect::string()->required(),
	'optional' => Expect::string(),
])->skipDefaults();

$processor->process($schema, ['required' => 'foo']);
// OK, returns {'required' => 'foo'}
```

Although `null` is the default value for the `optional` property, it is not allowed in input data (the value must be a string). Properties accepting `null` are defined using `nullable()`:

```php
$schema = Expect::structure([
	'optional' => Expect::string(),
	'nullable' => Expect::string()->nullable(),
]);

$processor->process($schema, ['optional' => null]);
// ERROR: 'optional' expects to be string, null given.

$processor->process($schema, ['nullable' => null]);
// OK, returns {'optional' => null, 'nullable' => null}
```

The array of all structure properties is returned by the `getShape()` method.

By default, no additional items can be present in the input data:

```php
$schema = Expect::structure([
	'key' => Expect::string(),
]);

$processor->process($schema, ['additional' => 1]);
// ERROR: Unexpected item 'additional'
```

This can be changed using `otherItems()`. As a parameter, pass the schema to validate each extra item:

```php
$schema = Expect::structure([
	'key' => Expect::string(),
])->otherItems(Expect::int());

$processor->process($schema, ['additional' => 1]); // OK
$processor->process($schema, ['additional' => true]); // ERROR
```

You can create a new structure by extending another using `extend()`:

```php
$dog = Expect::structure([
	'name' => Expect::string(),
	'age' => Expect::int(),
]);

$dogWithBreed = $dog->extend([
	'breed' => Expect::string(),
]);
```


Array
-----

An array with defined keys (since version 1.3.2). Everything that applies to [structures](#structures) applies to it.

```php
$schema = Expect::array([
	'required' => Expect::string()->required(),
	'optional' => Expect::string(), // default value is null
]);
```

Tuples: tuple()
---------------

A tuple is a fixed-size array where each position has its own schema (since version 1.4):

```php
$schema = Expect::tuple([
	Expect::int(),
	Expect::string(),
	Expect::bool(),
]);

$processor->process($schema, [1, 'hello', true]); // OK
```

When configurations are layered, a later tuple replaces the earlier one wholesale - mixing positions of two tuples is never what you meant. Positions beyond the shape can be allowed with `otherItems()`, which describes the rest elements.

Unlike a structure, a tuple does not accept `null` as an empty value; write `Expect::anyOf(Expect::tuple([...]), null)` when the value may be missing entirely.


Deprecated Properties
---------------------

You can mark a property as deprecated using the `deprecated([string $message])` method. Information about deprecation is returned using `$processor->getWarnings()`:

```php
$schema = Expect::structure([
	'old' => Expect::int()->deprecated('The item %path% is deprecated'),
]);

$processor->process($schema, ['old' => 1]); // OK
$processor->getWarnings(); // ["The item 'old' is deprecated"]
```


Description: description()
--------------------------

Any element can carry a human-readable description (since version 1.4). It has no effect on validation - the schema is often the only place where the meaning of a configuration option is written down at all, and `description()` is where you write it. It also travels into the [JSON Schema export](#exporting-to-json-schema):

```php
$schema = Expect::structure([
	'host' => Expect::string('localhost')->description('Database server hostname'),
	'port' => Expect::int(3306)->description('Port the server listens on'),
])->description('Database connection');
```


Ranges: min() max()
-------------------

Use `min()` and `max()` to limit the count for arrays:

```php
// array, at least 10 items, maximum 20 items
Expect::array()->min(10)->max(20);
```

For strings, they limit the length:

```php
// string, at least 10 characters long, maximum 20 characters
Expect::string()->min(10)->max(20);
```

For numbers, they limit the value:

```php
// integer, between 10 and 20 inclusive
Expect::int()->min(10)->max(20);
```

Of course, it is possible to specify just `min()` or just `max()`:

```php
// string, maximum 20 characters
Expect::string()->max(20);
```


Regular Expressions: pattern()
------------------------------

Using `pattern()`, you can specify a regular expression that the **entire** input string must match (i.e. as if it were wrapped in `^` and `$` characters):

```php
// exactly 9 digits
Expect::string()->pattern('\d{9}');
```

A pattern belongs to strings, just like `items()` belongs to arrays. Attach either of them to an element of a different kind and Schema raises a deprecation notice instead of silently ignoring the constraint (since version 1.4).


Custom Assertions: assert()
---------------------------

You can add any other constraints using `assert(callable $fn)`.

```php
$countIsEven = fn($v) => count($v) % 2 === 0;

$schema = Expect::arrayOf('string')
	->assert($countIsEven); // the count must be even

$processor->process($schema, ['a', 'b']); // OK
$processor->process($schema, ['a', 'b', 'c']); // ERROR: 3 is not an even count
```

Or

```php
Expect::string()->assert('is_file'); // file must exist
```

You can add a custom description to each assertion. It will be part of the error message.

```php
$schema = Expect::arrayOf('string')
	->assert($countIsEven, 'Even items in array');

$processor->process($schema, ['a', 'b', 'c']);
// Failed assertion "Even items in array" for item with value array.
```

The method can be called repeatedly to add multiple constraints. It can be interleaved with calls to `transform()` and `castTo()`.


Transformation: transform()
---------------------------

Successfully validated data can be modified using a custom function:

```php
// convert to uppercase:
Expect::string()->transform(fn(string $s) => strtoupper($s));
```

The method can be called repeatedly to add multiple transformations. It can be interleaved with calls to `assert()` and `castTo()`. The operations are performed in the order in which they are declared:

```php
Expect::type('string|int')
	->castTo('string')
	->assert('ctype_lower', 'All characters must be lowercased')
	->transform(fn(string $s) => strtoupper($s)); // convert to uppercase
```

The `transform()` method can simultaneously transform and validate the value. This is often simpler and involves less code duplication than chaining `transform()` and `assert()`. For this purpose, the function receives a [Nette\Schema\Context](https://api.nette.org/schema/master/Nette/Schema/Context.html) object with an `addError()` method, which can be used to add information about validation problems:

```php
Expect::string()
	->transform(function (string $s, Nette\Schema\Context $context) {
		if (!ctype_lower($s)) {
			$context->addError('All characters must be lowercased', 'my.case.error');
			return null;
		}

		return strtoupper($s);
	});
```


Casting: castTo()
-----------------

Successfully validated data can be cast:

```php
Expect::scalar()->castTo('string');
```

In addition to native PHP types, you can also cast to classes. It distinguishes between a simple class without a constructor and a class with a constructor. If the class has no constructor, an instance is created, and all structure elements are written to the properties:

```php
class Info
{
	public bool $processRefund;
	public int $refundAmount;
}

Expect::structure([
	'processRefund' => Expect::bool(),
	'refundAmount' => Expect::int(),
])->castTo(Info::class);

// creates '$obj = new Info' and writes to $obj->processRefund and $obj->refundAmount
```

If the class has a constructor, the structure elements are passed as named arguments to the constructor:

```php
class Info
{
	public function __construct(
		public bool $processRefund,
		public int $refundAmount,
	) {
	}
}

// creates $obj = new Info(processRefund: ..., refundAmount: ...)
```

Casting combined with a scalar parameter creates an object and passes the value as the single argument to the constructor:

```php
Expect::string()->castTo(DateTime::class);
// creates new DateTime(...)
```


Normalization: before()
-----------------------

Before the validation itself, the data can be normalized using the `before()` method. As an example, let's take an element that must be an array of strings (e.g., `['a', 'b', 'c']`), but accepts input in the form of string `a b c`:

```php
$explode = fn($v) => explode(' ', $v);

$schema = Expect::arrayOf('string')
	->before($explode);

$normalized = $processor->process($schema, 'a b c');
// OK and returns ['a', 'b', 'c']
```

The method can be called repeatedly (since version 1.4). The handlers are then chained, each receiving the result of the previous one:

```php
$schema = Expect::arrayOf('string')
	->before(fn($v) => explode(' ', $v))
	->before(fn($v) => array_map('strtoupper', $v));

$normalized = $processor->process($schema, 'a b c');
// OK and returns ['A', 'B', 'C']
```

Up to version 1.3, a second call to `before()` silently discarded the first one.


Mapping to Objects: from()
--------------------------

You can have the structure schema generated from a class. Example:

```php
class Config
{
	public string $name;
	public string|null $password = null;
	public bool $admin = false;
}

$schema = Expect::from(new Config);

$data = [
	'name' => 'Frank',
];

$normalized = $processor->process($schema, $data);
// $normalized instanceof Config
// $normalized = {'name' => 'Frank', 'password' => null, 'admin' => false}
```

Anonymous classes are also supported:

```php
$schema = Expect::from(new class {
	public string $name;
	public ?string $password = null;
	public bool $admin = false;
});
```

Because the information obtained from the class definition may not be sufficient, you can supplement the elements with your own schema using the second parameter:

```php
$schema = Expect::from(new Config, [
	'name' => Expect::string()->pattern('\w:.*'),
]);
```


Merging Multiple Configurations
-------------------------------

Applications often assemble their configuration in layers: there are built-in default values, and on top of them the user supplies their own settings, which should override only the items they actually specify. That is exactly what `processMultiple()` does - it takes several datasets, merges them in order so that later ones take precedence, and validates the final result as a whole:

```php
$schema = Expect::structure([
	'host' => Expect::string(),
	'port' => Expect::int(),
	'logging' => Expect::bool(),
]);

$defaults = ['host' => 'localhost', 'port' => 3306, 'logging' => false];
$userConfig = ['port' => 5432, 'logging' => true];

$config = $processor->processMultiple($schema, [$defaults, $userConfig]);
// $config = {'host' => 'localhost', 'port' => 5432, 'logging' => true}
```

The `host` item keeps its default value because the user did not set it, while `port` and `logging` are overwritten by the later dataset. Values stored under string keys are merged this way; numerically indexed items (lists) are appended one after another instead of being overwritten.


Exporting to JSON Schema
------------------------

Your schema is already a precise description of what the configuration may contain, and that description is useful outside PHP as well. `JsonSchema::export()` (since version 1.4) turns it into a [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org) document, the format editors read to offer completion and underline mistakes directly in the JSON or YAML file:

```php
use Nette\Schema\JsonSchema;

$schema = Expect::structure([
	'host' => Expect::string('localhost')->description('Database server hostname'),
	'port' => Expect::int(3306)->min(1)->max(65535),
	'user' => Expect::string()->required(),
]);

echo json_encode(JsonSchema::export($schema), JSON_PRETTY_PRINT);
```

```json
{
	"type": "object",
	"properties": {
		"host": {"type": "string", "description": "Database server hostname"},
		"port": {"type": "integer", "minimum": 1, "maximum": 65535},
		"user": {"type": "string"}
	},
	"required": ["user"],
	"additionalProperties": false
}
```

The export describes the **shape** of the data: types, ranges, patterns, required items, enum values and the texts you added with `description()`. Default values, `castTo()` and `transform()` are deliberately left out - they describe what happens to the data once it has been validated, and JSON Schema has no way to say that.

For the same reason, a type that exists only in PHP - a class such as `Expect::type(Address::class)`, a callable or a resource - throws `Nette\NotSupportedException` instead of producing a document that would quietly claim something else.


Under the Hood: normalize, merge, complete
------------------------------------------

Every schema element - whether built-in or one you write yourself - implements four methods that together define how it handles data. Three of them form the processing pipeline:

1. **normalize()** - prepares the raw input. This is where `before()` hooks run and where, for example, an object is turned into an array. It runs first, separately on each dataset.
2. **merge()** - combines two already normalized datasets, with the later one taking priority. This step is used only by `processMultiple()`; `process()` skips it, because it has just a single dataset.
3. **complete()** - performs the actual validation, fills in default values for missing items, and applies `assert()`, `transform()` and `castTo()`. It runs last, on the merged result.

The fourth method, **completeDefault()**, is called by the parent element for an item entirely missing from the input - it either supplies the default value or reports that a `required()` item is missing.

So `process()` runs *normalize → complete*, while `processMultiple()` runs *normalize (each dataset) → merge → complete*. This order is why `before()` sees the raw input, whereas `transform()` sees the already validated value.


Custom Schema Elements
----------------------

You can get a long way with `assert()`, `transform()` and `before()`, so you rarely need to build anything from scratch. But when you want a reusable, self-contained element with its own validation and merging logic, you can create one by implementing the [Nette\Schema\Schema](https://api.nette.org/schema/master/Nette/Schema/Schema.html) interface. It has exactly the four methods described above:

```php
interface Schema
{
	function normalize(mixed $value, Context $context);
	function merge(mixed $value, mixed $base);
	function complete(mixed $value, Context $context);
	function completeDefault(Context $context);
}
```

Errors are not thrown; instead you report them through the [Nette\Schema\Context](https://api.nette.org/schema/master/Nette/Schema/Context.html) object using `$context->addError()` and return `null`. The `Processor` gathers all errors and throws them together at the end.

As an example, let's build a reusable element for byte sizes in the friendly notation people use in configuration files - `'512kB'`, `'2 MB'` - which validates them and returns the number of bytes:

```php
use Nette\Schema\Context;
use Nette\Schema\Schema;

class ByteSizeSchema implements Schema
{
	private const Units = ['b' => 1, 'kb' => 1024, 'mb' => 1024 ** 2, 'gb' => 1024 ** 3];

	public function normalize(mixed $value, Context $context): mixed
	{
		return is_int($value) ? "$value B" : $value; // unify both notations
	}

	public function merge(mixed $value, mixed $base): mixed
	{
		return $value ?? $base; // the later value wins
	}

	public function complete(mixed $value, Context $context): mixed
	{
		if (!is_string($value) || !preg_match('~^(\d+)\s*([a-zA-Z]+)$~', $value, $m)) {
			$context->addError("The item %path% expects to be a size like '512kB'.", 'size.format');
			return null;
		}

		$unit = self::Units[strtolower($m[2])] ?? null;
		if ($unit === null) {
			$context->addError("The item %path% uses an unknown unit '$m[2]'.", 'size.unit');
			return null;
		}

		return (int) $m[1] * $unit;
	}

	public function completeDefault(Context $context): mixed
	{
		return null; // value used when the item is missing from the input
	}
}
```

You can use it anywhere a built-in element is expected - on its own or as part of a larger structure:

```php
$schema = Expect::structure([
	'maxUpload' => new ByteSizeSchema,
	'diskQuota' => new ByteSizeSchema,
]);

$processor->process($schema, ['maxUpload' => '2 MB', 'diskQuota' => 512]);
// OK, returns {'maxUpload' => 2097152, 'diskQuota' => 512}

$processor->process($schema, ['maxUpload' => '5 TB']);
// ERROR: The item 'maxUpload' uses an unknown unit 'TB'.
```

Because the element implements the whole interface, it also works automatically inside `processMultiple()` - the `Processor` calls its `merge()` method just like for any other element.
